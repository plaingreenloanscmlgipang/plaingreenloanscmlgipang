A lot of times, payday is the best day of the week or month because you feel as though you have enough money to go eat at your favorite restaurant or simply have a sense of security. However, there are some people for whom payday is just a fleeting moment when money goes into their checking account to be used for repaying numerous bills. This is especially true if you have taken out a payday loan because these loans do not lend any security to the large amount of money that you momentarily have in your checking account.

You may be wondering exactly what a payday loan is. Well, it is a short-term, small amount of money (between $100 and $1000) that is secured until your next payday. Usually these loans are secured with a post dated check or electronic agreement for debit from your bank account that will take place upon your next payday. These loans are usually easy to obtain as long as you have a steady job and a checking account since there is no credit check.
