Everyone encounters times of financial distress. Oftentimes, we rush to end this misery and get past the situation as soon as possible. Unfortunately, this may mean that you leap into a payday loan without fully understanding what one is. Of course, you probably already know that it is important to know what you are getting yourself into and how you will need to handle your loan later on.

The first thing that you should know is that a payday loan can be exactly what you need but it is not always the best choice in every situation. This is why you should be wary of the advertisements that are frequently seen. Regardless as to how desperate your situation may be, you will still need to take the time to consider all of your options before you decide upon the best course of action. There are some times when a payday loan will not be your best option.

So, what is a payday loan? It is a cash loan that is made on a short term basis. For this reason, you can usually only borrow between $100 and $1,000, depending upon what state you reside in. The majority of these loans are made for only 2 weeks, at which time you must repay them in full. The reason for this is that a payday loan is only meant to help you cover your costs, in case you have an emergency, until your next payday.
